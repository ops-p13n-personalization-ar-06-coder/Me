### Where to put them
- Put **`REFERENCE_INDEX.md`** at the repo root.  
- Optionally include **`HINTS_FOR_SOLVERS.md`** (root) if you share this repo with candidates.  
- Keep **`MAINTAINERS_FAIRNESS_CHECKLIST.md`** in root or under `/docs/` if you prefer.

If you’d like, I can also drop tiny per-example `README.md` stubs inside each example dir that just repeat the “how to run” section and point back to `REFERENCE_INDEX.md`.
